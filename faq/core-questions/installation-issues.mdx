# Common Installation Issues

This guide helps you navigate and resolve the most frequent installation challenges encountered when setting up RunRL. It focuses exclusively on installation-related hurdles, including platform prerequisites, typical errors during installation, and methods to verify a successful setup.

---

## 1. Installation Prerequisites

Before beginning installation, ensure your environment meets the following prerequisites:

- **Supported Operating Systems:** Windows 10 or later, macOS 11+, and commonly used Linux distributions.
- **Python Environment:** Python 3.8 or higher installed and accessible via your command line.
- **Network Access:** Reliable connection for downloading dependencies and accessing repositories.
- **Permissions:** Necessary rights to install software and write files on your system.

<Tip>
Always verify your Python version and `pip` installation using `python --version` and `pip --version` prior to starting.
</Tip>

For comprehensive prerequisite details, see the [System Requirements & Prerequisites](/getting-started/setup-introduction/prerequisites) guide.

## 2. Typical Installation Errors and How to Fix Them

Installation obstacles can arise due to system incompatibilities, missing dependencies, or permission issues. Below are the most common error scenarios and clear corrective actions:

### 2.1 Dependency Installation Failures

**Problem:** Errors occur when installing required Python packages (e.g., network timeouts, incompatible versions).

**Solution:**
- Verify network connectivity.
- Upgrade `pip` with `pip install --upgrade pip`.
- Install dependencies in a clean virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv runrl-env
source runrl-env/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
runrl-env\Scripts\activate.bat  # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- For persistent failures, consult your system’s package manager or firewall settings.

### 2.2 Permission Denied Errors

**Problem:** Installation commands fail due to insufficient privileges.

**Solution:**
- On Linux/macOS, use `sudo` cautiously, for example:

```bash
sudo pip install runrl
```

- On Windows, run the terminal as an Administrator.
- Alternatively, use a user-local install:

```bash
pip install --user runrl
```

### 2.3 Unsupported Platform or Python Version

**Problem:** Installation halts citing unsupported OS or outdated Python.

**Solution:**
- Confirm your OS is supported and upgrade if needed.
- Install Python 3.8 or newer from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Adjust your PATH environment variable to ensure the correct Python version is used.

### 2.4 Source Installation Issues

**Problem:** Errors cloning or building from source.

**Solution:**
- Confirm Git is installed and accessible: `git --version`
- Clone the official repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/runrl/docs.git
```

- Follow build instructions strictly, and ensure all dependencies for source builds are met (e.g., build tools).

<Warning>
Avoid using legacy or unofficial forks of RunRL to prevent versioning conflicts.
</Warning>

## 3. Verifying a Successful Installation

After completing installation, it’s critical to confirm that RunRL is correctly set up and operational.

Follow these verification steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Confirm Python Package Availability">
Run:
```bash
python -c "import runrl; print(runrl.__version__)"
```
Expected: Displays the installed RunRL version.
</Step>
<Step title="Run a Simple Command or Script">
Execute a basic RunRL operation as described in the [First Successful Run](/getting-started/first-steps/first-usage) guide to validate functionality.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Configuration Files">
Ensure key configuration files such as `source.config.ts` or `runrl.config` exist and contain your intended settings.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Logs for Errors">
Monitor any command-line output or log files for warnings or errors during initialization.
</Step>
</Steps>

### 3.1 Using the Quick Validation Checklist

For a fast, comprehensive verification, use the [Quick Validation Checklist](/getting-started/first-steps/validation-checklist) which guides you through environment validation, accessibility checks, and network permissions.

<Tip>
Successful verification prevents many issues during your first usage and saves troubleshooting time later.
</Tip>

## 4. Troubleshooting Tips

If problems persist after following the above steps:

- Ensure no conflicting Python installations exist.
- Clear any previously cached dependencies by running `pip cache purge`.
- Disable VPNs or firewalls that may block repository access.
- Consult the [Troubleshooting Setup Issues](/getting-started/first-steps/troubleshooting) page for guided diagnostics.
- Check system logs and run installation commands with verbose flags for detailed output.

<Check>
Maintain an organized environment using virtual environments to isolate RunRL and its dependencies.
</Check>
