# Why isn't my documentation page displaying?

This guide walks you through the essential steps to debug and resolve issues where a documentation page in RunRL Docs is missing, broken, or showing as blank. It focuses on diagnosing problems related to content source retrieval, MDX rendering, and page metadata configuration.

---

## Understanding the Page Loading Flow

When you request a documentation page, RunRL Docs fetches the page content and metadata from the source adapter, renders it using MDX components, and displays it within the documentation layout. Failure in any step can cause the page to not display correctly.

### Key Points in the Page Rendering Pipeline

- The system locates the page content via the `source.getPage(slug)` method using the URL slug.
- If no page data is returned, a 404 Not Found error is triggered.
- The MDX content is then rendered with customized components for links and UI elements.
- Metadata such as the page title and description is generated dynamically.


## Common Causes for Documentation Pages Not Displaying

### 1. Content Source Issues

The page data may be missing or incorrectly linked in the content source adapter.

- **Cause:** The slug (URL path) doesn’t match any existing page.
- **Indicator:** The `source.getPage(slug)` returns `null` or `undefined`, leading to a 404.
- **Action:**
  - Verify that the page exists in your content folder structure (usually under `content/docs`).
  - Ensure the slug generated by your navigation or URL matches the actual page path.
  - Check the source adapter configuration that loads your pages (e.g., `.source/index.ts` or `source.config.ts`).

### 2. Metadata or Frontmatter Issues

Pages require valid frontmatter metadata to render correctly.

- **Cause:** Missing or malformed frontmatter (title, description, etc.)
- **Indicator:** The page loads blank or throws errors during rendering.
- **Action:**
  - Confirm frontmatter is present at the top of your `.mdx` file.
  - Validate frontmatter fields follow the schema defined in your `source.config.ts` frontmatter schema.
  - Use linting or schema validation tools to catch errors early.

### 3. MDX Rendering Problems

Errors in the MDX content or custom components can block proper rendering.

- **Cause:** Invalid MDX syntax or missing components.
- **Indicator:** Blank page or runtime errors console logs.
- **Action:**
  - Preview the MDX content in isolation using tools like MDX playground.
  - Verify that custom components are properly imported and registered (see `getMDXComponents` function).
  - Check dynamic linking functions (like `createRelativeLink`) for errors or misconfiguration.

### 4. Routing Configuration

Incorrect dynamic routing may prevent page resolution.

- **Cause:** Dynamic route parameters don’t match the expected page slug.
- **Indicator:** 404 pages instead of content.
- **Action:**
  - Review your Next.js dynamic route files (e.g., `app/docs/[[...slug]]/page.tsx`).
  - Ensure `generateStaticParams` correctly generates params from your content source.
  - Confirm routing matches your navigation structure.


## Step-by-Step Troubleshooting Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Confirm Page Exists">
  Validate that your target documentation page exists in the content repository at the expected path with the correct `.mdx` filename.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Slug and Paths">
  Compare the URL slug you use in navigation or the browser with the source page path. They must correspond exactly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Frontmatter Metadata">
  Open the page `.mdx` file and confirm that required frontmatter fields (`title`, `description`) are present and valid.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Source Adapter Configuration">
  Inspect files like `source.config.ts` and `.source/index.ts` to ensure the content source properly loads your page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Inspect MDX Rendering Logic">
  Confirm that the MDX content renders correctly by testing components registered in `getMDXComponents`. Look for runtime errors.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Examine Routing and Navigation">
  Check your dynamic routing setup to ensure the path parameters are generated and matched correctly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Console and Network Logs">
  Use browser developer tools to look for rendering errors, failed resource loads, or 404 responses when fetching page content.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test in Isolation">
  Render the MDX content separately or create a minimal test page to isolate rendering issues.
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Use consistent slugs:** Establish a naming convention to avoid mismatch between URLs and content paths.
- **Validate frontmatter strictly:** Use schema validation during authoring to prevent broken metadata.
- **Leverage hot reload:** During development, use the live reload feature to catch MDX syntax or import errors quickly.
- **Centralize MDX components:** Maintain a single source of truth for custom MDX components to avoid registration issues.
- **Monitor errors early:** Configure error boundaries in your rendering pipeline to catch and display useful debug info.


## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Omitting the required frontmatter fields or using incorrect data types.
- Renaming or moving `.mdx` files without updating related routes or navigation links.
- Forgetting to register new custom components used in MDX.
- Relying on implicit routing assumptions without generating parameters correctly.


## Troubleshooting Examples

<AccordionGroup title="Example Issues and How to Fix Them">
<Accordion title="Page Not Found (404) for Existing Page">
If the page exists in your content but displays a 404:
- Check if the slug array passed to `source.getPage(slug)` correctly matches the page's file path.
- Run `source.generateParams()` and verify it includes your page.
- Confirm your navigation or links point to the correct slug.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Page Loads but Content is Blank">
- Inspect the MDX file for empty content or missing export.
- Check frontmatter metadata for required fields.
- Look at console for rendering errors caused by MDX syntax or missing components.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Metadata (Title and Description) Not Showing">
- Verify that your page's `generateMetadata` function successfully returns metadata.
- Confirm frontmatter includes the fields used to construct metadata.
- Check that no errors occur before metadata generation.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## When to Seek Further Support

If, after following these steps, your documentation page still does not display as expected:

- Consult the [Troubleshooting Common Issues Guide](/guides/usage-patterns/troubleshooting) for detailed workflows.
- Reference the [Basic Navigation Guide](/guides/getting-started/basic-navigation) to confirm your understanding of routing and page resolution.
- Reach out to RunRL Docs support or community forums with detailed error logs and reproduction steps.
