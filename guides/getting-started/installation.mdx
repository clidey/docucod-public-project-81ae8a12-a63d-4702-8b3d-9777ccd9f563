# Installing and Setting Up RunRL Docs

RunRL Docs is designed to provide a streamlined documentation experience for robotics developers using reinforcement learning. This guide walks you through installing and setting up the RunRL documentation system on your local machine or environment so you can start contributing or consuming documentation quickly.

---

## 1. Workflow Overview

### What This Guide Helps You Accomplish
You'll install all necessary dependencies, understand the project structure, perform initial configuration, and run the documentation site locally or in your environment.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed (v14 or later recommended)
- NPM or Yarn package manager
- Basic familiarity with terminal/command prompt usage

### Expected Outcome
After completing this guide, you'll have RunRL Docs running locally with full navigation and search capabilities enabled.

### Estimated Time
15-30 minutes

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate

---

## 2. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Get the latest RunRL Docs source code from GitHub.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/runrl/docs.git
cd docs/rldocs
```

After cloning, navigate to the `rldocs` directory where the Next.js application lives.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Install all required Node.js packages.

```bash
npm install
# or
pnpm install
# or
yarn install
```

This command sets up `fumadocs-ui`, `fumadocs-mdx`, and other required libraries.

### Step 3: Understand Project Structure
Familiarize with key files and folders:

- `app/`: Contains the Next.js app entry and layout (`layout.tsx`) integrating global providers like search.
- `lib/source.ts`: Configures your documentation content source adapter.
- `.source/source.config.mjs` and `source.config.ts`: Define the MDX and metadata schema configurations.
- `content/docs/`: Where the actual documentation MDX content lives.
- `next.config.mjs`: Applies MDX integration for Next.js.

This structure allows seamless authoring and rendering of documentation pages.

### Step 4: Run the Local Development Server
Start the Next.js server to preview documentation.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the live documentation site.

### Step 5: Verify Setup
Confirm the site loads with:
- Navigation menu showing section groups and pages
- Search box powered by Orama search
- Content pages rendering markdown and MDX correctly

If these elements display, your setup is successful.

## 3. Initial Configuration

### Edit `source.config.ts` for Customization
Customize frontmatter schemas and MDX options if you want tailored metadata validation or MDX features.

Example snippet:

```ts
import { defineConfig, defineDocs, frontmatterSchema, metaSchema } from 'fumadocs-mdx/config';

export const docs = defineDocs({
  docs: { schema: frontmatterSchema },
  meta: { schema: metaSchema },
});

export default defineConfig({
  mdxOptions: {
    // Customize MDX parsing and plugins here
  },
});
```

This controls how documentation frontmatter and metadata validate and render.

### Customize `app/layout.tsx` for UI Enhancements
You can modify the global layout, including fonts, theming, and search integration.

For example, the setup uses Google's Inter font and integrates `fumadocs-ui` providers for unified theming and search.

---

## 4. Tips & Best Practices

- **Keep dependencies updated:** Regularly run `npm update` to stay current with latest fixes.
- **Write frontmatter carefully:** Use defined schemas to maintain consistency in metadata.
- **Test changes locally:** Use the development server before pushing changes.
- **Use MDX components:** Leverage custom MDX components provided by `fumadocs-ui` for rich documentation content.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Setup Issues">
<Accordion title="The Server Doesn't Start or Shows Errors">
- Ensure Node.js and your package manager versions meet requirements.
- Delete `node_modules` and reinstall dependencies.
- Check for typos or missing config files.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Documentation Content Not Rendering">
- Verify MDX files exist in `content/docs/`.
- Confirm your `source.config.ts` is correctly imported and applied.
- Ensure your import paths stay relative and correct.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Search Is Not Working">
- Confirm `SearchProvider` is wrapping your app in `layout.tsx`.
- Make sure content indexing has completed in dev mode.
- Check console for errors related to Orama search.
</Accordion>
