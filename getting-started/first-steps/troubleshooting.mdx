# Troubleshooting Setup Issues

Welcome to the troubleshooting guide dedicated to resolving common challenges you may encounter while installing RunRL and completing your first use of the product. This guide will help you quickly diagnose problems, understand frequent error scenarios, and recover smoothly to keep your development on track.

## 1. Common Installation Issues and Fixes

RunRL's installation can occasionally encounter hurdles on different platforms or due to prerequisite gaps. Follow these actionable steps and tips to resolve install-time problems:

### 1.1 Dependency Problems
- **Issue**: Missing or incompatible Python version.
  - **Fix**: Ensure Python 3.8 or higher is installed and active.
    ```bash
    python --version
    ```
- **Issue**: Required packages or tools not found.
  - **Fix**: Install pip and install any missing dependencies manually.
    ```bash
    python -m ensurepip --upgrade
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### 1.2 Installation Command Fails
- **Issue**: Permission denied errors.
  - **Fix**: Run installation commands with appropriate user privileges or use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    python -m venv runrl-env
    source runrl-env/bin/activate
    pip install runrl
    ```
- **Issue**: Network or proxy blocking package downloads.
  - **Fix**: Check network connectivity, configure proxy environment variables as needed.
  - Try fetching packages manually to diagnose.

### 1.3 Platform-Specific Gotchas
- On Windows, ensure all environment variables are properly set, especially PATH to Python and pip.
- On Linux/macOS, check for missing system build tools (`build-essential`, `gcc`, `make`).

<AccordionGroup title="Installation Troubleshooting Tips">
<Accordion title="Verify Basic System Setup">
Before installing, confirm your system matches the [System Requirements & Prerequisites](../setup-introduction/prerequisites).

Check Python version and availability:

```bash
python3 --version
pip3 --version
```

Ensure access rights and network connectivity.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Use Virtual Environments">
Isolate RunRL installation by creating and activating a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv runrl-env
source runrl-env/bin/activate
```

This avoids conflicts with other Python packages.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Check Logs for Traceback Details">
If installation fails, review the console output logs carefully.
Look for specific error messages and Google or consult RunRL forums for targeted fixes.

## 2. Troubleshooting First Run Problems

Once installed, you may encounter issues starting RunRL or running your first operation. Use the following steps to diagnose and resolve these:

### 2.1 Run Environment Errors
- **Symptom**: Command not found or cannot start RunRL.
  - **Fix**: Confirm that the RunRL executable or script is in your PATH.
  - Use the absolute path or source your environment if using virtual environments.

### 2.2 Configuration File Issues
- **Symptom**: Errors about missing or invalid configuration.
  - **Fix**: Verify your configuration files (e.g., `source.config.ts`) follow the expected format.
  - Compare with samples from [Configuration Basics](/getting-started/setup-introduction/configuration-basics).

### 2.3 Authentication Failures
- Check your credentials are set correctly if your RunRL setup requires authentication.
- Refer to [Authentication Troubleshooting](/faq/troubleshooting/authentication-errors) for detailed steps.

### 2.4 Runtime Exceptions
- Look for error stack traces in your terminal.
- Validate that input files/data conform to expected formats as explained in [File Formats](/file-formats).

## 3. FAQ & Diagnostic Quick Checks

Use this quick checklist when things donâ€™t work as expected:

- **Is your Python version supported and active?** Run `python --version`.
- **Are required dependencies installed without errors?** Check installation logs and run `pip list`.
- **Is your network stable and unrestricted?** Confirm no firewalls or proxies block package repositories.
- **Is your configuration file correct and accessible?** Refer to the sample config file in the Configuration Basics guide.
- **Have you activated your virtual environment if used?** Use `source runrl-env/bin/activate`.
- **Do you have proper permissions to install/run commands?** Use elevated permissions or admin rights as required.
