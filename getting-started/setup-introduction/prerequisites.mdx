# System Requirements & Prerequisites

Before installing RunRL, it is essential to ensure your system meets the necessary requirements and dependencies. This guarantees a smooth installation and setup experience, enabling you to quickly move forward to building and running your first reinforcement learning project in real-world robotics.

---

## 1. Supported Operating Systems

RunRL supports the following operating systems for development and deployment:

- **Linux** (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or later recommended)
- **macOS** (Catalina 10.15 or later)
- **Windows** (Windows 10, version 1903 or later; Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) recommended for compatibility)

> While RunRL may run on other OS variants, these are the officially tested and supported platforms.

---

## 2. Hardware Requirements

Ensure your machine meets the baseline hardware specs:

- **Memory:** Minimum 8 GB RAM; 16 GB or higher recommended for large-scale experiments.
- **Disk Space:** At least 5 GB free disk space for installation and datasets.
- **Processor:** Modern multi-core CPU (Intel i5/Ryzen 5 or better).

> For projects involving GPU acceleration, ensure your GPU drivers are installed and updated separately.

---

## 3. Software Dependencies

RunRL relies on a few core dependencies that must be installed on your system before proceeding.

### 3.1 Python Environment

- Python **3.8** or newer

It is recommended to use a virtual environment manager such as `venv` or `conda` to avoid conflicts with system Python packages.

```bash
python3 --version
# Expected Output: Python 3.8.x or higher

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv runrl-env
source runrl-env/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
runrl-env\Scripts\activate   # Windows
```

### 3.2 Required Libraries

RunRL installation handles most Python package installations. However, ensure you have the following base tools:

- **pip** updated to the latest version
- **git** for version control and cloning repositories

To update `pip`:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

---

## 4. Network & Access Requirements

- Reliable internet connection for downloading dependencies and packages.
- Firewall settings and proxy configuration may need adjustment to allow package manager traffic (e.g., pip, npm/yarn).
- For access to private repositories or resources (if applicable), ensure your credentials and SSH keys are configured beforehand.

---

## 5. Permissions and Accounts

- Admin or sudo privileges may be required during installation for modifying system packages or drivers.
- Access to online package repositories (e.g., PyPI) without restrictions.

---

## 6. Summary Checklist Before Installation

<Check>
- Confirm your OS is supported
- Verify Python 3.8+ is installed and accessible
- Set up and activate a Python virtual environment
- Ensure `pip` and `git` are installed and functional
- Verify hardware meets minimum memory, storage, and CPU requirements
- Confirm internet access and firewall settings are compatible
- Have necessary credentials ready (if private repositories or resources are involved)
</Check>

## Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Python Version Not Found or Too Low">
Ensure Python 3.8 or greater is installed and reachable from your command line:

```bash
python3 --version
```

If an older version appears, install a newer Python or configure your PATH correctly.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Virtual Environment Activation Fails">
On Windows, be sure to run the Command Prompt or PowerShell as Administrator, and if execution policies block scripts, run:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

Then try activating the environment again.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Firewall or Network Blocks Package Downloads">
Check proxy or firewall settings, or try downloading packages manually from a network with fewer restrictions. Configuring environment variables like `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` might be necessary.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Insufficient Disk Space or Memory Errors">
Free up disk space and close unnecessary applications to free RAM. Consider upgrading hardware if running large experiments.
