# SDKs & Integration Tools

Leverage official SDKs and integration tools designed to accelerate your development with the RunRL Docs API. This page guides you through available SDK support, integration patterns, and best practices so you can consume the API faster, more reliably, and with less complexity.

---

## Why Use SDKs & Integration Tools?

SDKs provide ready-made client libraries in popular programming languages that abstract network calls, handle authentication, and structure responses for you. Integration tools complement these by offering patterns and utilities to seamlessly embed RunRL Docs capabilities into your existing workflows or applications.

Using these official resources helps you:

- Save development time with tested, maintained client code
- Reduce errors from manual request construction and parsing
- Improve security by leveraging built-in authentication management
- Gain access to language-specific helpers and idiomatic interfaces


## Available SDKs

RunRL Docs currently offers SDK packages tailored to common programming languages and environments. These SDKs are regularly updated to reflect API changes and include comprehensive documentation and examples.

| SDK          | Language        | Installation Command               | Primary Use Case                     |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `runrl-python`  | Python          | `pip install runrl`               | Python applications, data science  |
| `runrl-js`      | JavaScript/TypeScript | `npm install @runrl/sdk`         | Web apps, Node.js backend           |


### Installation Examples

#### Python
```bash
pip install runrl
```

#### JavaScript (npm)
```bash
npm install @runrl/sdk
```


### Quick Start Example: Python
```python
from runrl import RunRLClient

client = RunRLClient(api_key='YOUR_API_KEY')
response = client.search(query='robotics reinforcement learning')
for doc in response.results:
    print(doc.title)
```

### Quick Start Example: JavaScript
```javascript
import { RunRLClient } from '@runrl/sdk';

const client = new RunRLClient({ apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY' });

async function runSearch() {
  const response = await client.search({ query: 'robotics reinforcement learning' });
  response.results.forEach(doc => console.log(doc.title));
}

runSearch();
```


## Integration Patterns

Successfully integrating RunRL Docs API into your project involves choosing the right pattern for your context. Below are common approaches:

### 1. Direct SDK Usage

Embed SDK clients directly into your application or backend service. This suits apps needing real-time or on-demand documentation search or retrieval.

### 2. Server-Side Proxy

Setup a backend endpoint that interfaces with RunRL SDK, applies additional logic or caching, and exposes tailored data to your frontend. This adds security and customization layers.

### 3. Static Content Enrichment

Use integration tools in your CMS or build pipeline to pull RunRL documentation metadata or search indexes, enriching your content with dynamic references or preprocessed data.


### Best Practices for Integration

- **Manage API Keys securely:** Never expose keys in client-side code without protection.
- **Implement retry logic:** Leverage SDK built-in features or your own to handle transient network errors.
- **Cache results:** Reduce API calls for frequent queries to improve performance.
- **Respect rate limits:** Use the SDK’s handling of rate limits and backoff.
- **Keep SDKs updated:** Regularly upgrade SDK versions to access new features and patches.


## Troubleshooting Common Integration Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Problems and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Authentication Failures">

Ensure your API key is valid and has the necessary scopes. SDKs will raise clear errors when authentication fails – check error messages carefully. Consider regenerating keys if issues persist.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Network Errors and Timeouts">

Verify network connectivity and firewall rules. Utilize SDK configured retry mechanisms. Increase timeout settings in SDK configuration if needed.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Unexpected API Responses">

Ensure you are using the latest SDK version compatible with the current API. Check the SDK documentation for any breaking changes or required updates.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Rate Limit Exceeded">

Throttle your requests or implement exponential backoff. Monitor request volumes and optimize calls to avoid unnecessary repeated queries.
